    <p style="padding: 5%;">The medicinal plants generally have a wide range of antimicrobial activities and many phytochemical properties owing 
        to the presence of a number of active alkaloids, flavonoids, 
        various amino acids and carbohydrates. Catharanthus roseus is 
        one of the important medicinal plants, due to the presence of 
        the indispensable anti-cancer drugs, i.e., vincristine and 
        vinblastine. It has medicinal importance owing to the presence 
        of alkaloids like ajamalicine, serpentine and reserpine, which 
        are well known for their hypotensive and antipasmodic 
        properties. This study focuses on the green synthesis of 
        nanoparticle from the leaves and flower of Catharanthus 
        roseus (Periwinkle) which has been proven against malaria 
        parasite Plasmodium Falciparum. The production of AgNPs 
        was visually detected by the colour changes of the reaction 
        mixture from yellow to reddish brown. The UV-spectrum 
        showed the plasmon resonance peak. The silver nanoparticles 
        formed were predominantly cubical with uniform shape. The 
        morphology of the nano particles has observed through 
        Transmission Electron Microscopy.
